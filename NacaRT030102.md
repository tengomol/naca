# NacaRT - Configuration - Common parameters - Accounting #

## Configuration ##

### Accounting configuration ###

> nacaRT holds accounting informations for statics and billing purpose.

> They are defined here in tag `<Accounting>` stored within tag `<conf>`.
> The accounting system holds it's own DB connection that is not shared with the connection use dby application programs.

> Thus, many parameters defines this DB connection.

> `conf/Accounting/MachineId`
> String value.
> Physical machine name.

> `conf/Accounting/TomcatId`
> String value.
> Name of the tomcat instance.

> `conf/Accounting/TableName`
> String value.
> Name of the db table that stores accounting infos.

> `conf/Accounting/MaxLevelDepth`
> Integer value.
> Billing can be set at different levels.
> Set 0 for storing an account only when starting a new transaction.
> Set 1 for storing an account when starting a new transaction, or starting a top level program.
> Set 2 for storing an account when starting a new transaction, or starting a top level program, a sub program.
> Set typically the parameter to "0".

> `conf/Accounting/dburl`
> String value.
> Gives the jdbc url identifying the database holding the accounting table.

> `conf/Accounting/dbuser`
> String value.
> Database user able to insert record in the accounting table.

> `conf/Accounting/dbpassword`
> String value.
> Database user password able to insert record in the accounting table.

> `conf/Accounting/dbConnectionUrlOptionalParams`
> Optional parameter string appended to dburl.
> It must be set to `"clientProgramName=$FoundPoolName;"`

> `conf/Accounting/dbenvironment`
> Database environment. This is the accounting table prefix.

> `conf/Accounting/driverClass`
> JDBC driver class name used to connect to the db.
> Set it to `"com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver"` for DB2 or UDB support.

> `conf/Accounting/CloseCursorOnCommit`
> Boolean value.
> DB Connection option that must be set to `"true"`.

> `conf/Accounting/AutoCommit`
> Boolean value.
> DB Connection option that must be set to `"true"`.

> `conf/Accounting/validationQuery`
> SQL clause that must always succeed, used to check the connection validity.
> Used to validate the DB connection after opening it.

### Connection pooling ###

> All nacaRT DB connections are pooled internally.
> This includes the accounting connections.
> The pooling supports multiple pools.
> In the case of accounting, there is only one pool.

> `conf/Accounting/Pools/Pool/Name`
> Gives the name of the db connection pool used for accounting.
> Must be set to `"Accounting"`.

> `conf/Accounting/Pools/Pool/ProgramId`
> Gives the name of the program that can use this connection pool.
> Must be set to `"Accounting"`.

> `conf/Accounting/Pools/Pool/MaxConnection`
> Integer value.
> Maximum number of connections that this pool can hold.
> When an accounting record must be inserted, a connection is obtained from the pool, and is SQL statement is issued.
> Then, the connection returns to the pool.
> If at a certain moment all connection are used, then the next program requesting an accounting insertion must wait until one of the db connection is released.

> `conf/Accounting/Pools/Pool/TimeBeforeRemoveConnection_ms`
> Time in milliseconds during which a connection can stay open without being used.
> When the connection is used, it's last usage time is resetted.
> When the last usage time is higher than this quantiy of milliseconds, then the connection and it's prepared statements are closed and removed.
> This is done by the GC thread.
> This value must not be longer than the corresponding database parameter.
> In fact, the db engine can pro-activelly close an obsolete connection, and nacaRT won't be informed of this event.
> It's best to close the connection before the db engine.

> `conf/Accounting/Pools/Pool/MaxStatementLiveTime_ms`
> Time in milliseconds during which a prepared statement can stay open without being used.
> If a statement is unused for too long, the DB engine may close it aggressivelly, and nacaRT has no way to be informed of that fact.
> Thus, it's best to close an unsued statement before the db engine own timout value.
> This cleanup is done by the GC Thread and when a connection is returned to it's pool.

> `conf/Accounting/Pools/Pool/UseExplain`
> Boolean value. Set to `"false"`.
