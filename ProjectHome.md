**Original post july 2008**:
NACA was about replacing an IBM mainframe under MVS/OS390 (zOS) with Intel servers on Linux. The project started in January 2003 and successfully ended on june 30, 2007. It was on purpose implemented in a 100% iso-functional way, i.e. without any functional / applicational improvement brought during the process of  trans-coding itself and by the transcoding engine. 4 millions lines of COBOL were 100% automatically trans-coded toward their Java equivalent.

The savings in cash-outs amounted to a total of 3 millions euros, 85% of the initial yearly level.

Publicitas now release its homegrown tools for this transcoding in open source
