# NacaRT - Configuration - Common parameters - General parameters #

## Miscellaneous ##

> `conf/SequencerFactoryClass`
> String that gives the fully qualified class name of the Program Loader Factory used for online program.
> Must be set to `"idea.onlinePrgEnv.OnlineProgramLoaderFactory"`.
> Mandatory field.

> `conf/LogSettingsPathFile`
> String that gives the full file name of the logger configuration file. See JLib documentation for details on this file.
> Mandatory field.

> `conf/LoadCopyByPrimordialLoader`
> TO BE FILLED

> `conf/ServerName`
> Name of the server as displayed in user's browser.

## Programs preload ##

> `conf/PreLoadAllProgramFromDir`
> Boolean value.
> If true, then all programs located in a directory are preloaded.
> The load time will be longer, but the 1st user sessions will be faster.
> All the programs (.class) only that will be in the folder defined by the field `ApplicationClassPath` will be loaded.
> To be set to `false` in production mode.
> It can be used to estimate the total cost of memory non-heap of a certain amount of programs.
> Only the transcoded programs of type program can be preloaded.
> Mandatory field.

> `conf/PreLoadAllProgramFromList`
> Boolean value.
> If true, then all programs identified by a file are preloaded.
> The list is located in the variable `PreLoadProgramList`.
> This value is taken in consideration only if `PreLoadAllProgramFromDir` is set to false, meaning that `PreLoadAllProgramFromDir` has a higher priority than `conf/PreLoadAllProgramFromList`.
> Mandatory field.

> `conf/KeepPreloadedProgramList`
> Boolean value.
> Used only if `conf/PreLoadAllProgramFromDir="true"`.
> In that case, the list of all preloaded programs is stored in a file whose name is stored into `PreLoadAllProgramFromList`.
> Mandatory field.

> `conf/PreLoadProgramList`
> Full file name used for holding a list of files to preload.
> It's usage is:
    * The file is open and the list is read to preload files, if `conf/PreLoadAllProgramFromList="true"`
    * The file is open and the list is written with the list of preloaded files, if `conf/KeepPreloadedProgramList="true"`
> Mandatory field.

> `conf/AsynchronousPreloadPrograms`
> Boolean value; It's used only if `conf/PreLoadAllProgramFromDir="true"` or `conf/PreLoadAllProgramFromList="true"`.
> If they are both "false", then this flag is not used.
> It's usage is:
    * if true, then the server is started, and then all programs are preloaded (asynchronously).
> > > This enables users to start working without waiting for all programs to be preloaded.
    * if false, then all programs are preloaded, and then server is started, so that users must wait for all programs to be preloaded before working.


> `conf/GCAfterPreloadPrograms`
> Boolean value. Used only if `conf/PreLoadAllProgramFromDir="true"` or `conf/PreLoadAllProgramFromList="true"`.
> If they are both "false", then this flag is not used.
    * if true, then a `System.GC()` call is forced after having preloaded all programs.
> > This helps minimizing garbage collector activity.
    * if false, then no `System.GC()`

## Program loading ##


> Cobol like programs are loaded by nacaRT.

> There are various modes:
    * Programs can be loaded by java primordial class loader.
> > > This is activated by setting `conf/CanLoadJar="false"` and `conf/CanLoadClass="false"`.
> > > In that case, programs can't be unloaded.
> > > The class files are loaded by a directory specified by the tomcat classloader or by the `CLASSPATH` variable.

  * Programs can be loaded by nacaRT own class loader.

> > To activate that mode, set `conf/CanLoadJar="true"` or `conf/CanLoadClass="true"`.
> > The class files are loaded by one of the directories specified by `conf/ApplicationClassPath`.
> > In that case, programs can be unloaded (warning: this has a deep impact on garbage collection, and is discouraged).

  * If `conf/CanLoadJar="true"` and `conf/CanLoadClass="true"} (they are both {{{"true"`), then nacaRT's internal class loader will first try to load a class by searching it in one of the directories specified by `conf/ApplicationClassPath`.
> > If it doesn't find the class, then it tries to search for it within the jar file specified by `conf/JarFile`.
> > This jar file must be stored in one fo the directories given by `conf/ApplicationClassPath`.


> This prioritzing enables to setup a new version of a given program as a .class file, without re-creating the jar file.

> `conf/UseProgramPool`
> Boolean value.
> It should be set to "true", so that programs instances are cached, so that an already loaded program instance can be reused for other executions.
> This is very important for online programs that are often reused.
> Mandatory field.

> `conf/MaxSessionExecTime_ms`
> Number of milliseconds that can use a given user session without being aggressivelly killed.
> It should not be set too low, nor too high, and must be adjused.
> A user session that will long more than this parameter value will be killed automatically.
> A user session destroying information will be sent in the critical log.
> The goal is to avoid infinite loops.
> Mandatory field.

> `conf/ApplicationClassPath`
> This parameter is very important as, it gives list of semi colums separated paths (.class and/or .jar).
> Example:
> > `conf/ApplicationClassPath="d:/dev/naca/pub2000Online/bin;d:/dev/naca/pub2000Commons/bin;D:/Dev/naca/CJTests2/CJTestDev2/bin"`
> > This paths are the path where programs and copy binary files are loaded if the nacaRT internal class loader is used.

> Mandatory field.

> `conf/JarFile`
> Name of the `.jar` file containg all programs and copy binaries, and ressources screens.
> Only one `.jar` file can be specified.
> It is used only if `conf/CanLoadJar="true"`.
> In that case, it must give the file name of a jar file located in one of the directories specified by `conf/ApplicationClassPath`.
> Mandatory field.

> `conf/CanLoadJar`
> Boolean value.
> If true, then the `conf/JarFile` file can be used for loading a program or copy.
> If false, then the `conf/JarFile` file cannot be used for loading a program or copy.
> Beware: in case `CanLoadClass="true"`, then the programs having a binary representation in a `.class` file will be taken prior than the ones that are stored into the `.jar` file.
> Mandatory field.

> `conf/CanLoadClass`
> Boolean value.
> If true, then a class can be loaded in one of the directory specified by `conf/ApplicationClassPath`.
> Beware: in case `CanLoadJar="true"`, then the programs having a binary representation in a `.class` file will be taken prior than the ones that are stored into the `.jar` file.
> This particular behaviour allows when launching the server, not to take the programs stored into the `.jar`.
> In case a correction is coming, it will be delivered as a `.jar` file.
> The JMX console will be used to reload this module at runtime.
> The version that will be used will be then the last available `.class` file.
> Mandatory field.

### JVM configuration ###

> `MaxSizeMemPoolCodeCache_Mb`
> Maximum size value in mega bytes of the short term pool code cache (typically set to "64").
> This value is used to follow the memory consumption via the JMX console.
> To be used for Debug and Optimization purposes only.
> This parameter is only indicating an information value, it is not defining the maximum value of it. The JVM parameters are really defining this parameter.
> Mandatory field.

> `MaxSizeMemPoolPermGen_Mb`
> Maximum size value in mega bytes of the long term pool code cache (typically set to "300").

> Must be set accordingly to the size of all programs that can be loaded simultaneously.
> This value is used to follow the memory consumption via the JMX console.
> To be used for Debug and Optimization purposes only.
> This parameter is only indicating an information value, it is not defining the maximum value of it. The JVM parameters are really defining this parameter.
> Mandatory field.

## SQL Caches ##

> NacaRT uses internally multiple cache for performance reasons.

> `conf/UseSQLStatementCache`
> Boolean value.
> If "true", then all prepared SQL statements are cached and can be reused by the current program instance, or another program instance, until the underlying DB connection is destroyed.
> If "false", then the statement cannot be used twice.
> It gives a large performance penalty to set it to "false".
> Mandatory field.

> `conf/UseSQLObjectCache`
> Boolean value.
> If true, then all SQL java object attached to a given prepared statement are cached and can be reused, until the contained prepared statement is to be removed.
> This is having sense only if `UseSQLStatementCache="true"`.
> If false, then this caching is not activated. It should not be set to "false" for performance reasons.
> Mandatory field.

> `conf/UseVarFillCache`
> Boolean value.
> Select and cursor SQL statements returns java Resultsset objects.
> Each resultset's column's value is stored in a cobol-like destination variable.
> Searching for the correct destination cobol-like variable is a time consuming process.
> If this flag is set to "true", then this search is done only once, thus giving an important performance advantage.
> This is having sense only if `UseSQLObjectCache="true"`.
> Mandatory field.

> `conf/ManageVarDefCatalog`
> Boolean value
> Cobol-like variable are split in 2 parts, the variable's value, and it's definition.
> A variable definition is constant among all instances of a given program stored into a same working structure.
> This working structure is shareable between all the same programs instance, each program having however individually its own copy of all the varaibles described into the shared working strucuture.
> The saving in terms of non-heap memory is considerable.
> Then set this variable to "true" to enable such sahring, giving a big memory size optimization, without CPU costs.
> Mandatory field.

## Char mapping - Ascii / EBCDIC ##

> Some DB chars must be mapped specifically to another code in internal nacaRT storage space.

> The mapping is different depending the way data are accessed.

> `conf/CodeJavaToDb`
> String value giving a comma separated list of couples values.
> Used to map char code when writing data to DB. Each couple member is separated by a dash.
> Must be set to "255-159,10-133" while using DB2 (EBCDIC encoding) database.
> If the DB used is UDB (which implies UNICODE encoding), then this parameter must be set to "".

> `conf/CodeDbToJava`
> String value giving a comma separated list of couples values.
> Used to map char code when reading data form DB.
> Must be set to "159-255" while using DB2 (EBCDIC encoding) database.
> If the DB used is UDB (which implies UNICODE encoding), then this parameter must be set to "".

> `conf/ComparisonMode`
> Flag that identifies how internal comparisons are done, independantly from their encoding.
> Must be set to "EBCDIC", so that digits are considered after letters, as in EBCDIC encoding.
> This enables to have the same sorting results as EBCDIC data, even if internal variable storage uses ASCII encoding order.
> Normally, this flag should be set to "ASCII", but this implies using UDB, and having application that does not rely on the fact that digits are ordered after letters.
> That is that applictions must not be dependant on the EBCDIC collating sequence.

## Application opening / close ##

> The application can be run within a specific time frame.
> Open/Close operations are run using 2 XML files that are containing several calendars and 1 manual option to close the application.
> Thus, a calendar defines these settings.
> When the application is not open, then a user requesting an online application gets a screen teeling him that the application is closed.
> It is also possible to force the close of nacaRT by using a JMX button.

### The Standard Calendar configuration file ###

> The tag `<conf/StandardCalendar>` of the nacaRT.cfg configuration file is containing the path and file name to an xml file where standard week open time are defined.

> This file looks like:

```
 <Settings>
	<Day Value="Mon">
		<Open Min="06:00:00" Max="19:00:00"/>
		<Open Min="19:30:00" Max="20:00:00"/>
	</Day>
	<Day Value="Tue">
		<Open Min="06:00:00" Max="20:00:00"/>
	</Day>
	<Day Value="Wed">
		<Open Min="06:00:00" Max="20:00:00"/>
	</Day>
	<Day Value="Thu">
		<Open Min="06:00:00" Max="20:00:00"/>
	</Day>
	<Day Value="Fri">
		<Open Min="06:00:00" Max="20:00:00"/>
	</Day>
	<Day Value="Sat">
		<Open Min="06:00:00" Max="16:00:00"/>
	</Day>
	<Date Value="01/05/2009">
		<Open Min="06:00:00" Max="16:00:00"/>
	</Day>
 </Settings>
```

> It gives the list of application open time for all days of a standard week.

> The tags `<Day>` can have one or several 

&lt;Open&gt;

 tags that are indicating the opened windows.
> The opened window are handled using the mathematical `[min, max[`, min value included, max value excluded.

> The tags `<Date>` can have one or several 

&lt;Open&gt;

 tags that are indicating the opened ranges, and one or several 

&lt;CloseRange&gt;

 tags that are indicating the closed ranges.

> The file can contain one or several tags `<Date>` to handle special days, like holiday days.
> The tags `<Date>` are taken in consideration prior to the `<Day>` dates.

### The Custom Calendar configuration file ###

> The tag `<conf/CustomCalendar>` of the nacaRT.cfg configuration file is containing the path and file name to an xml file where custom days open time are defined.

> This file looks like:

```
 <Settings>
	<!--
	<Date Value="JJ/MM/YYYY">
		<Close Min="10:50:00" Max="14:50:59"/>
		<Open Min="14:51:00" Max="14:51:59"/>
	        <Close Min="14:52:00" Max="14:52:59"/>
	</Date>
	-->
	<Date Value="05/03/2007">
		<Close Min="00:00:00" Max="05:59:59"/>
		<Open Min="06:00:00" Max="18:59:59"/>
		<Close Min="19:00:00" Max="23:59:59"/>
	</Date>
 </Settings>
```

> The custom Calendar configuration file can contain only `<Date>` tags to give special open or close dates.

> The file can contain one or several tags `<Date>` to handle special days, like holiday days.
> The tags `<Date>` are taken in consideration prior to the `<Day>` dates.

> All the open/close ranges must be written sorted in growing order starting from the minimum.

### Algorithm ###

> The algorithm that is controlling if the application is open or closed is working in the following manner:

  * Examination of the Custom Calendar configuration file
    * In case the current day is matching with one 

&lt;Date&gt;

 tag defined in this file, the open/close ranges for the current day are applied.
    * In case the current day is NOT matching with one 

&lt;Date&gt;

 tag defined in this file, the program is examining the Standard Calendar configuration file.
      * In case the current day is matching with one 

&lt;Date&gt;

 tag defined in this file, the open/close ranges for the current day are applied.
      * In case the current day is NOT matching with one 

&lt;Date&gt;

 tag defined in this file, the open/close ranges for the current day are defined regarding the 

&lt;day&gt;

 definitions if present.

  * In the Custom Calendar configuration file, hours that are defined outside the open/close ranges are looked at in the Standard Calendar configuration file.
  * In the Standard Calendar configuration file, hours that are defined outside the open/close ranges are considered closed.

> Beware:
> Open/Close ranges cannot overlap totally or partially for a same day.
> We cannot have the following definition:

```
 <Settings>
	<Date Value="05/03/2007">
		<Open Min="12:10:00" Max="14:30:00"/>
		<Close Min="14:00:00" Max="15:00:00"/>
	</Date>
 </Settings>
```

> What is the status at 14:15? Open or close?

> The JMX interface is having a #App\_Close or a #App\_Open that is allowing to close or open the application manually.

> The manual closure or opening is prior than to the calendars.

> Before closing manually an application, it is possible to fill in a field `__ManualCloseReason` giving the reason of the application closure.
> Beware: Press enter after writing the reason and then click on `SetManualClose`.
