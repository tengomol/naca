# JLib - Logger - Usage #

## JLib Logger usage ##

> The logger uses a XML configuration file to set the various supported output and their options.
> There is also some java methods to call for generating log events.

### Program operations ###

> Create a configuration file as described below
> Initialize the global log object, by specifying it's configuration file:

```
  Log.open("Test", "D:/Dev/JLogWriterTest/src/net/publigroupe/config/Logging.ini", "RunId", "ProductId");
```

> Comments:

> The Field having value "Test" identifies the channel.
> The field RunId identifies the current run; Its optional. if not provided, it will be replaced by a unique value generated at run time, BUT ONLY If USING a DBFLAT LogCenter.
> The field ProductId identifies the products. It may be null if not required.

> These 2 last fields are optionals, but can be used to have results' filtering after process execution.

  * Do all applications operations, including sending log events:
    * Create a custom log class. You can use STModuleGen application to generate your custom log object.
    * Send the log to all available log writers:
```
    LogEventEndCrawl.log(www.microsoft.com, nNbMilliseconds, "Crawling over");
```

> The event will by dispatched synchronously to all enabled log writer.
> A log writer is enable if all the following conditions are met:

  * Its parameter "Enable" in configuration file is set to true, or if it's status has been dynamically set to true (to be done).
  * It's channel must matches log event channel. In previous sample, the channel is "Test". It is provided in the static log method, at the line Log.log(

&lt;Channel&gt;

, event, Message).
  * It's flow must be either "any" or exactly match the flow indicated in the log event constructor.
  * It's level must be lower or equal than the level declared by log event constructor; the valid levels are given in descending order:
    * Critical
    * Important
    * Normal
    * Verbose
    * Debug
    * FineDebug

> At program end, close logger:

```
  Log.close();
```
