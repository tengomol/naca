> Automatic migration of Cobol to maintainable Java (transcoding + runtime)

> NACA was about replacing an IBM mainframe under MVS/OS390 (zOS) with Intel servers on Linux.
> The project started in January 2003 and successfully ended on june 30, 2007.
> It was on purpose implemented in a 100% iso-functional way, i.e. without any functional / applicational improvement brought during the process of  trans-coding itself and by the transcoding engine.
> 4 millions lines of COBOL were 100% automatically trans-coded toward their Java equivalent.

> The savings in cash-outs amounted to a total of 3 millions euros, 85% of the initial yearly level.

> Publicitas now release its homegrown tools for this transcoding in open source
