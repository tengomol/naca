# Naca - Whitepaper - Required environments #

## Introduction ##

> Naca targets a Java environment for enterprise legacy applications.

> There are multiple environment to consider, depending on it's usage.

> Most components are open source based, thus helping lowering considerably the cost of ownership of these infrastructure elements.

## Production environment ##

### Production server infrastructure ###

> Depending on application scaling, multiple physical servers may be required.

> Each server must match these requirements:
    * Standard Intel/AMD X86 hardware with optional multi-core/multi-CPU support.
    * Linux 32 or 64 bits.
> > > 64 bits is recommended for large applications support due to memory constraints on 32 bits platforms...
> > > The preferred distribution is RedHat Enterprise, but other choices are possible.
    * Sun's Java JRE >= 1.5 in 32 or 64 bits edition.
    * Apache's Tomcat.
    * NacaRT library, and the required third part libraries.


> These required libraries are all open source software only.

  * Transcoded application binaries.
  * Production environment configuration files.

### Central database server ###

> It can be either:

  * MVS based:
    * IBM DB/2 with DRDA access.
> > > Note: The access to DB2 through DRAD impose a performance penalty.
> > > However, cares has been taken by NacaRT to limit at most this penalty.
  * X86 based:
    * IBM UDB on x86 computer.

### File server to store flat files for batch processing ###

  * Linux box on Intel X86 hardware.

### End user workstation ###

  * Any Windows computer with Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 or 7 support.


> Note:  There is no additional hardware / software requirement.
> All screens outputs produced by Naca are HTML based.
> Thus, there are no deployment requirements for user workstations.

## Development Environment ##

### Principle ###

> This environment is used before migration to prepare it, and after to maintain the applications.

### Server infrastructure ###

  * Source code repository (CVS for example), using a Windows / Linux box.
  * NacaTools web server.
    * Linux box on Intel X86 hardware
    * Tomcat
    * Ant or Anthill Pro
    * Ant scripts for build processing
    * NacaTools web site
  * File server to store flat files for batch processing
    * Linux box on Intel X86 hardware

### Developer workstation ###

> These persons are in charge of maintaining the Cobol or Java source code.

> Requirements:

  * Intel/Amd X86 computer with at least 1Gb of Ram (2Gb recommanded).
  * Windows or Linux.
  * Sun Java JDK >= 1.5.
  * JMX console.
  * Tomcat.
  * Eclipse >= 3.2 with Tomcat integration plug-in.
  * NacaTrans Eclipse plug-in.
  * CVS / Subversion repository integration.
  * NacaRT + third part libraries.
  * Source code of Cobol files.
  * Tools to access to various Linux boxes.

### Tester workstation ###

> The testing phase prior migration imposes the creation of scenarios.
> These scenarios are scripts that are created by running a instrumented QWS3270 terminal emulation software.
> The persons who create these scenarios require this commercial component.

> Requirements:
    * X86 hardware running Microsoft Windows. XP Professional (Vista untested).
    * Jolly Giant's QWS3270 and it's naca custom modification.
