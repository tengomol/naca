# Naca - Whitepaper - Tools details #

## Cobol to Java transcoder: NacaTrans ##

> This tool is a critical component of the naca software stack.

> It can convert the following type of Cobol source files:
    * CICS programs
    * Batch programs
    * UDB Stored procedure
    * Copy
    * Called programs

> This tool takes a Cobol source file or list of Cobol source files and produces one or many output Java source files.
> The dependencies for a given Cobol source file are taken in account during transcoding operation.
> For example, if a CICS program requires a copy source, it's also transcoded.
> The list of file to transcode can be grouped by category (Batch / Online) and by CICS transaction.

> The transcoder produces the following files:
    * Java output files representing:
      * Online programs, from Cobol - CICS input programs.
      * Batch programs, from Cobol - batch input programs.
      * Batch programs, from Cobol - batch input programs.
      * Store procedure programs from Cobol DB2 stored procedures.
      * Called programs from Cobol routines, used as a called program.
      * Copy files from Cobol Copy.
      * Copy file and XML resource file from CICS Map screens Copy.
    * An error/warning output list.
    * A statistics file, giving metrics of the transcoded sources.
    * A log file.

> The transcoder can be used in multiple containers, depending on it's usage:
    * As a centrally managed resource, either through the integration server or directly through the build server.
> > > This is used for daily/continuous transcoding build.
    * As a local developer's tool, into he's workstation.
> > > This is used as a standalone developer tools.
    * As an Eclipse plug-in. This feature enables Cobol developers to maintain Cobol source files, even after the migration is completed.
> > > This permits Java untrained Cobol developers to maintain Cobol source code.
> > > They can develop / maintain Cobol source files, transcode them in Java within their Eclipse environment, and then run them directly in Eclipse.
> > > This helps lowering stress and formation pressure to the Cobol teams.


> The programs produced by NacaTrans are not bound to a specific container.
> In fact, they can run the same in these various containers:

> In production:
    * Within a Tomcat web-apps container.
    * As a Command line executable.
    * Within a UDB instance, as a stored procedure.
    * Legacy transcoded programs can be reused by normal java applications. Thus, they are interoperable.

> In development stages:
    * Within a Tomcat web-apps container.
    * As a Command line executable.
    * Within the NacaTools server, for testing purpose and playback scenario execution.
    * Within a UDB instance, as a stored procedure.
    * Within a Tomcat web-apps container using remote debugging.
    * Within the Eclipse debugger, optionally using a profiler (JProfiler for example).

## Naca runtime library: Naca's NacaRT ##

> This java files generated by the transcoder makes a wide usage of a Naca specific runtime library.
> This library supports and emulates a full MVS Cobol syntax support and some Online and Batch utilities.
> It also supports execution of transcoded  Filepac scripts.
> NacaRT is another critical part of the Naca Software Stack.
> It requires Sun or IBM JRE (Java Runtime Environment) version 1.5 or greater.

## Naca operation management: Naca's NacaTools ##

> This component is implemented as a web server.
> It provides multiple screens, to ease daily operations before, during, and after migration.
> These covered operations include:
    * As a initial preparation step, all programs must be inventoried and registered.
> > > This inventory part is centrally managed by the "NacaTools" server.
    * During preparation of the migration, all programs must be converted.
> > > The various stages of conversion for all inventoried programs are maintained by this web-server.
    * All converted programs must be deeply tested before migration.
> > > These tests can be run manually or automatically, and their status are registered centrally.
    * Statistics can be generated, reporting the advancement of conversions and tests.
    * Before and during migration, files must be transferred from host to servers.
    * After migration, some programs may be still maintained as Cobol source files.
> > > NacaTools automates the daily conversion of these programs...
    * During tests and after migration, servers must be monitored. A screen that sums-up all servers' status is available.
