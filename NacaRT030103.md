# NacaRT - Configuration - Common parameters - Garbage Collection #

## Configuration ##

> These parameters are given in a tag `<GCThread>` within main `<conf>` tag.

> NacaRT uses an internal thread that periodically do internal cache cleanup.

> `conf/GCThread/ActivateThreadGarbageCollectorStatement`
> Must be set to "true" to activate this cleanup thread.
> If set to false, then the other parameters are ignored.

> `conf/GCThread/GarbageCollectorStatement_ms`
> Number of milliseconds, defining a period of wait time.
> When this period has elapsed, the thread is activated.
> This value is typically set to 5 minutes (300000 milliseconds).

> `conf/GCThread/MaxPermanentHeap_Mo`
> Defines a threshold in mega-bytes for the JVM permanent heap size.
> When the permanent heap size if higher than this value, then the cleanup processing is activated.
> It size must be consistent with the JVM memory space allocated.

> `conf/GCThread/NbStatementForcedRemoved`
> Defines the quantity of SQL prepared statements to force remove when the permanent heap size is too large.
> The prepared statements that were executed the longest time ago (and then are currently unused) are removed first.
> The sum of prepared statements removed if kept and is compared to the value of `conf/GCThread/NbStatementsToRemoveBeforeGC`.
> Only this quantity of prepared statements can be removed in one run of the GC thread.
> Removing this prepared statements happens only when the GC threads is activated.
> It's purpose it to lower the permanent heap size where prepared statements are holded, thus preventing a memory overflow.
> Ideally, prepared statement should never be removed in such a way.
> Thus, when memory is correctly tuned, this parameter must be set to `"0"`.

> `conf/GCThread/NbStatementsToRemoveBeforeGC`
> The number of statements removed is cumulated.
> When it reaches `NbStatementsToRemoveBeforeGC`'s value, then a garbage collector is forced.
> This helps avoiding memory overflow.

> `conf/GCThread/NbSystemGCCall`
> Number of `System.GC()` call to do when garbage collector must be forced.
