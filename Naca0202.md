# Naca - Whitepaper - Transcoding and runtime concepts #

## Transcoding process ##

> Transcoding is automatic and 99% of time does not require configuration file.
> The transcoder automatically reports when it needs a specific configuration file for a given program.

> Transcoding process:

> Naca deals with Java code generation and execution.

> The generated code thus must meet some strong points.

> The generated java uses a Cobol-like syntax.
> It's as close as possible from original Cobol syntax, within of course the limits of the Java language.

> Generated code doesn't look like classical native java and is not object oriented from the application point of view.

> This is a by design strong choice, to enable a smooth migration of Cobol developers to the Java environment.
> The goal is to keep business knowledge in the hand of people who wrote the original Cobol programs.

> All Java transcoded programs must sports the following characteristics:

  * Maintainable by the Cobol team
  * Give similar results as original code
  * Achieve at least similar performance response time as their host origins
  * Application monitoring and statistics

## Maintenance ##

> Human maintenance implies that Java generated programs have the following characteristics:

  * They are humanly readable.
  * The Java generated code is to be maintained by trained Cobol developers, with a thin leaning curve of the Java environment and tools.
> > They are not intended to be maintained by trained Java developers.
  * Transcoded program must achieve a 1 to 1 line matching with the Cobol program.
> > This implies that they are not object oriented, and that the original line ordering is kept.
  * A maximum of code checking must be done at compilation time, not at runtime.
> > This guarantees a maximum correctness of a program, even when it's maintained manually.
  * SQL statements must be directly visible in the source code, as is the case in MVS Cobol.
> > It's technically dynamic SQL, but syntaxically looks like static SQL.
  * They must be testable easily.
  * Central compilation, or during development, in a developer workstation's Eclipse is required.
  * They can be debugged in an Eclipse environment within the developer's computer.
  * Remote debugging must be supported.
  * Execution must provide at least the same error diagnostics as the Cobol root.
> > In fact, better diagnostics are offered, for example by checking at runtime if a given occurs index is in the validity range.

## Results correctness ##


> This is achieved by the following rules:

  * Transcoded programs are a direct transcription of the Cobol source, using Java syntax instead of Cobol syntax.
  * The NacaRT library provides a software layer that emulates a complete Cobol runtime, with all it's specificities.
> > This is the key point that guarantees similar execution.

## Performances ##


> Performances are achieved by the using following techniques:

  * NacaRT handles many caches for a lot of internal resources. The following resources are strongly cached. For example:
    * Programs and program instances
    * Variables
    * SQL connections, statements, resultset columns, ?
> > > In fact, SQL is very deeply cached, with more than 5 levels of caching.
  * Screen IO requires CPU intensive XSL transform. These transforms are in fact compiled once for during the 1st program instance execution, and reused later.
  * Online programs sessions are naturally executed concurrently. Each session runs in it's own private thread.

> > Thus, the whole system benefits directly form modern multi-core CPU architetures.
  * Batch program are sequential and mono-threaded by nature. However, internal or external sorting are multi-threaded to achieve good results.
> > File accesses are cached in NacaRT, on top of Java JRE own cache, which itself lives on top of the OS own file system cache.
  * Java JRE >= 1.5 is mature and it's various memory management pools are efficient.
  * Garbage collection is sometimes a blocking operation done at will by Java JRE.
> > It's not possible to avoid completely these steps, but a lot is done in NacaRT to keep and reuse objects as often as possible.
> > This helps limiting these kinds of blocking garbage collections. However, a fine tuning of the JVM parameters has to be set.

## SQL Support and characters encoding ##

### Database ###


> MVS Cobol targets a DB2 database, and uses EBCDIC character set.

> Java uses internally Unicode UTF-16 character representation, which is completely different from EBCDIC.
> Transcoded programs may be run using a mainframe DB2 instance, or a UDB instance.
> UDB can be setup in a selectable character encoding.
> However, the recommendations are to use Unicode UTF-16 character sets.

### Batch files ###

> The same situation occurs for batches.
> Host needs ECBDIC, while Naca must support either ASCII or EBCDIC encodings.

> Note:ASCII is a subset of Unicode UTF-16.

### NacaRT support ###

> NacaRT provide a mean to deal with these various character representations.
> Internally, everything is based upon Java standard, UTF-16.

> When reading or writing data to a database, the database driver does automatically the required conversions at runtime.

> When reading or writing data to a file, NacaRT file access layer does also the required conversions at runtime.
> It takes care to convert only required fields, depending on their Cobol type as described in the program source code.
> For example, numeric encoded comp-3 fields must not be converted, as their value does not depend on their character set.

> This is a powerful mechanism that covers all required conversions aspects, even in external sort.

> For example, it's possible to sort an EBCDIC file by using ASCII comparisons, if required.

> External sorting uses collating sequences to compare key-segments in the required representation.

### Monitoring ###

> Transcoded online programs are executed in a Tomcat container, that hosts Java JMX (Java Management eXtensions) services.
> NacaRT adds various JMX Mbeans components that permits the following remote operations, through a JMX console:

  * Checking memory, threads and loaded classes usage.
  * Access to NacaRT general statistics, showing for example:
    * Number of active cached DB connections.
    * Number of active cached prepared SQL statements.
    * Number of correctly executed transactions.
    * Number of erroneously executed transactions.
    * Number of loaded programs.
    * Number of currently running programs.
  * Application site can be closed or open at will, or by using a planed open/close calendar.
  * Log settings can be updated.

> Another important source of statistics is provided by registration in a central DB of a record when an Online transaction is run, and when it's terminated.
> This in-DB transaction log provides a mean to bill transactions.
