### Tag explanations ###

#### Tags ####

  * Settings/GetCallerLocation: True if tack call must be logged; false otherwise
  * Settings/CallLocation/Exclude: The value give the name of a java package that must be ignored form stack call. Multiple tags may be specified
  * LogCenters/ LogCenter: There may be multiple tags, each with it's own particularities
  * LogCenters/ LogCenter / Enable: Boolean that indicates whether the log channel is enable or not
  * LogCenters/ LogCenter / NbRequestBufferSize: Integer that defines how many requests will be grouped befors being flush on output writers
  * LogCenters/ LogCenter / Asynchronous: Boolean that defines if the writing operation is done asynchronously or not.
  * LogCenters/ LogCenter / Channel: Identifies the channel that can be used to send data to this log center. Only log event belonging to the correct channel can be sent by this log writer.
  * LogCenters/ LogCenter / Mode: Identifies 2 things:
  * The destination (Console, File or Database)
  * The formatting for file output
> > Value must belong to: "Console" |"FileST6"|"FileRawLine"|"FileSTCheck" |"FileChunk"|"Db"
  * LogCenters/ LogCenter / Level: Identifies the minimum level value acceptable for a log line to be written.
> > Value must belong to: "Critical" | "Important" | "Normal" | "Verbose" | "Debug" | "FineDebug"
  * LogCenters/ LogCenter / Flow: Identifes which flow can be catch by current LogCenter.
> > Value must belong to: "System" | "Monitoring" | "Trace" | "Any" | "None"
> > "Any" indicates that no restriction on flow is done
> > "None" desactivate the current LogCenter: it will never receive any log.

#### Specifics items depending on Mode ####

  * For Console Mode or RawLine Mode:
    * LogCenters/ LogCenter / Format: format is currently used only by mode="Console".
> > > A formatting string can be specified; it can contains embedded variable placeholders:
    * %Message: Replace by the log message
    * %ThreadName: Replaced the thread name
    * %ThreadId: Relaced by the thread id
    * %Timestamp: Replaced by the time stamp at which log was called; it is different form current time
    * % StartTime: Number of milliseconds that elapsed since process startup. Determined at log call time
    * %CR: Carriage return char
    * %LF: Line feed char

  * For File Mode:
    * LogCenters/ LogCenter / FilePath: String that give an absolute or relative path where logs files are stored; the path is created is necessary.
    * LogCenters/ LogCenter / FileName: String that gives the name of the log file; It is created as necessary.
    * LogCenters/ LogCenter / FileStrategy: "Append" | "BackupOnstart"; Indicates what to do upon process startup with the current (if existing) log file.
    * LogCenters/ LogCenter / Backup / BackupPath: Path used if "BackupOnstart" Filestrategy is declared for current LogCenter. It is created as necessary
    * LogCenters/ LogCenter / Backup / BackupFileFormat: File name of the backup file within backup path. The name can contains the reserved keywords:
      * BackupDateTime: It is replaced at backup time by the current displayable date time in format YYYYMMDD\_HHMMSS
    * LogCenters/ LogCenter / Backup / MaxBackupFileCount: Number of file to keep in backup directory. Only the most recent one are kept, old one are removed definitly.

  * For Database mode (Mode="Db"):
    * DbUser: String that gives the db connection user
    * DbPassword: String that gives the db connection password
    * DbUrl: String that gives the db connection url
    * DbProvider: Either "MySQL", "Oracle" or "DB2" depending on DB service used
    * MasterTable: Name of the table used as the log master. the table structure is described below

#### XML parameters ####

  * DbUser must give the name of the DB user to use
  * DbPassword must give the password of the DB user to use
  * DbUrl must give the URL of the DB instance to use
  * DbProvider: one of "MySQL"|"Oracle"|"DB2" (currently, only "MySQL" is supported, other are to be done)
  * Table: Gives the name of the table used for log event write
  * TableRunId: Gives the name of the table used to generate a RuntimeId, and a RunId if none are provided at Log.open() time
  * Machine: Gives the name of the machine execution the process to be logged
  * Process: Give the name of the process to be logged
  * RunMode: Gives a string identifying the run mode (TLog / Prod, ...)
  * LogEventDefinitionTable: Gives the name of the table used for event definition registration

### Standard log events and events type ###


> There are various already built standard events. All these events must identify the channel they are using.

  * LogEventStartProcess: Typed LogEventType.Start; Automatically sent when the logger is started. Nothing to do at the application level.
  * LogEventStopProcess: Typed LogEventType.Stop; Must be sent when application is being shutdown.
  * LogEventAbortProcess: Typed LogEventType.Abort; Must be sent when application is being aborted.
  * LogEventProgress: Typed LogEventType.Progress; Must be sent when an item processing is being progressing, and we want to get a trace of the advancements. 3 parameters are to be provided: int nNbItemsProcessed, int nNbItemsToProcess, String csMessage. The message can be null.
  * LogEventReport: Typed LogEventType.Report; Must be sent when an item processing is finished. 3 parameters must be provided: int nNbItemsProcessed, int nNbItemsSucessfullyProcess, String csMessage; the message can be null.
  * LogEventLaunchProcess: Typed LogEventType.Launch; Must be sent before launching another process. 2 other parameters must be provided: , LaunchedRunId, and and optinalMessage. The LaunchedRunId must match the parameter that will be given in the launched process as a RunId in the Log.open() method. This enables log viewers to chain logically the 2 processes.
  * LogEventAliveProcess: Typed LogEventType.Process; Must be sent to report that the process is alive.

> It is important to use these standard events as required, because they are intended in log viewer application for post execution analysis.

> All these standards events provides 2 different log() methods, with or without a String csProduct argument. If no csProduct is provided, then the default csProduct value given at log.open() time is used, otherwise it's the specified value that is used.

### Sample custom log object ###

```
 package net.publigroupe.logEvent;
 import jlib.log.*;
 
 public class LogEventEndCrawl extends LogEvent
 {
 public LogEventEndCrawl(String csProduct)
 
 Unknown macro: { super(LogEventType.Rem, LogFlow.Any, LogLevel.Normal, csProduct); }
 public static LogEvent log(String csUrl, int nNbMs, String csMessage)
 {
 return LogEventEndCrawl.log(null, csUrl, nNbMs, csMessage);
 }

 public static LogEvent log(String csProduct, String csUrl, int nNbMs, String csMessage)

 Unknown macro: { LogEventEndCrawl event = new LogEventEndCrawl(csProduct); event.fillMember("URL", csUrl); event.fillMember("NbMs", nNbMs); Log.log("Test", event, csMessage); return event; }
 }
```

> Explanations: The constructor gives the event type, Flow restriction and minimal level that this log applies to.
> The first static method log(...) is the log event call using the default product, specified at log.open() time.
> The second static method log(...) is the log event call using a specific product, replacing the value specified at log.open() time.
