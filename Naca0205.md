# Naca - Whitepaper - Testing #

## Introduction ##

> Tests are critical to a successful migration preparation.
> It requires various steps for a given transaction, and all programs must be thoroughly controlled.
> What's more, testing online transaction implies different controls from testing batch programs.

## Testing ##

### Testing Online transactions ###

> The following operations are typically done for a test:

> Scenario creation; done only at a preliminary stage:
    * First, the Database is setup in known state.
    * Then, a scenario is created.
> > > This is done manually by running an instrumented 3270 terminal emulator that executes the targeted application in the host environment.
    * These scenarios are kept and managed centrally in the NacaTools Web server, with the queries that had setup the database in it's initial state.


> Scenario playback, executed at will:
    * This database tables are setup in the initial state.
    * Then can scenario is replayed at will in the host environment, or in the Naca environments.
> > > This playback can be manual or automatic, by virtue of the NacaTools web server.
    * Screens outputs produced in both execution modes are comparable, and the NacaTools web server provides a mean to automate these comparisons.
    * The comparison's results generate a status, reflecting the correctness of the Naca mode execution.
> > > Some screen fields can be safely ignored by the automatic comparer.
> > > For example, the displayed current date or time is not to be taken in account by the comparison process.
    * Database state after execution can be compared to the database state after scenario creation.
> > > Thus, the database state after execution in Naca environment must be identical to the database state after scenario capture within the Host environment.
    * A playback status is affected to a scenario, giving coverage statistics.


> All the scenario playback sequence can be automated in the NacaTools server:
    * database reset
    * scenario execution by Naca or host environment
    * comparison of produced outputs
    * comparisons of database state

> Thus the following tools are offered:
    * CICS scenario registration, using specially modified QWS 3270 terminal emulation software.
> > > These executions are targeted to the mainframe computer.
    * Automatic or manual CICS scenario playback through this 3270 terminal emulation software, capturing outputs screens.
> > > These executions are targeted to the mainframe.
    * Manual CICS scenario playback through a web browser, executing programs into the Naca environments.
    * Automatic CICS scenario playback through specific open source terminal emulator, executing programs into the Naca environments.
    * Automatic comparison of outputs produced by executing a scenario in 3270 mode, or naca mode.
    * Before scenario registration and playback, the database can be set-up in a known state.
    * After scenario playback, the database state can be checked.
    * All these operation can be centrally managed by the NacaTools web-server.

### Batch testing ###

> Batch programs are tested by using a different pattern.

> The following steps are done to test a program, within a application chain.

> A complete batch chain test is different from a single program test.
> This point is not covered in this document.

> The first steps for testing a single batch program are done on the mainframe environment:
    * Program is identified.
    * Program input files are identified.
    * Database is set in an known state.
    * Program is run on the mainframe, producing displayed outputs and output files.

> The input files, outputs files and database initial setup are then stored in the NacaTools website.

> This file transfers are done by using a NacaTools option.
> The files character encoding may be changed from EBCDIC to ASCII at will during the transfer.
> Care is taken to not converter non convertible fields, for example comp-3 numeric encoded fields.

> Then, at will, the transcoded Java program can be run from the Naca environment.

> A run test consists in the following operations:
    * Database is setup again in the initial stage.
    * The program is launched either form the command line, or through NacaTools.
> > > It is provided with file logical names. Files can be either encoded in EBCDIC or ASCII forms.
    * After program execution, output produced files are compared to the host originated output files.
> > > These comparisons take care of course of the files' respective encodings.
> > > That is an ASCII Java produced file can be compared to an EBCDIC host produced file.
    * Display outputs are also compared between the two executions mode.
    * At last, it's possible to compare the database tables.
    * All these comparisons are centrally done by the NacaTools web server, and generated a test status to the program.


> Note about database: The mainframe environment implies DB2 usage for Database operations.
> However, Naca supports Host DB2, or UDB.
> These two different instances can used at will during program execution in the Naca environment, to check for differences in DB operations.
> This is to be done in particular in regards to data EBCDIC / ASCII encoding. NacaRT hides lots of encodings complexities.
