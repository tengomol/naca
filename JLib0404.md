> Initialisation:

> In main file:

```
   Log.open("Test", "D:/Dev/JLogWriterTest/src/net/publigroupe/config/Logging.ini", "Run1", "Crawler");
```

  * Test is the channel; it must match items in ini configuation file.
  * D:/Dev/JLogWriterTest/src/net/publigroupe/config/Logging.ini: Is the path to the configuration file.
  * Run1 identifies the run id; It is used to group chained processes.
  * Crawler identifies the product.
> > This call will result in a LogEventStartProcess event to be sent.


> If progress execution is to be logged, the following will be done:

```
  Log.LogEventProgress.log("Test", nNbItemProcessed, nNbItemToProcess, "Process in way ...");
```

> After processing of all items:

```
  Log.LogEventProgress.log("Test", nNbItemProcessed, nNbItemSuccessfullyProcessed, "Process done");
```

> To report the previously defined custom log event LogEventEndCrawl call:

```
  LogEventEndCrawl.log(csDomainUrl, nElpasedTimeInMilliseconds, "Domain crawled");
```

> There is no need to provide the channel id, as it is already specified in the LogEventEndCrawl log method.

> Before launching a child process, we identifies the child process name:

```
  LogEventLaunchProcess.log("Test", "ChildProcess", "Lauching analyser process");
```

> In the child process, we will find:

```
  Log.open("Test", "D:/Dev/JLogWriterTest/src/net/publigroupe/config/Logging.ini", "ChildRunId", "Crawler");
```

> The field "RunId" has the value "ChildRunId"; this will enable the logviewer to connect these 2 processes.
