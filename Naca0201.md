# Naca - Whitepaper - Introduction #

## Introduction ##

> The NacaTrans implements a Cobol to Java transcoder engine.
> It's designed as a compiler, that takes Cobol BMS source files and output is java or XML files.
> As a compiler, it uses a traditional compiler architecture: lexer, syntax analyser, semantic analyser, generator.
> All these compilations steps are implemented in the single Naca's Nacatrans module.

### Document purpose ###

> This document won't explain internal architecture of NacaTrans, but only explains the configuration possibilities.

### Licence ###

> Naca is currently made of 4 different projects:

  * JLib, Publicitas Java base library, licenced under LGPL2 terms.
  * NacaRT, Naca transcoded program base library, licenced under LGPL2 terms.
  * NacaTrans, Cobol to Java transcoder, licenced under GPL2 terms.
  * NacaRTTests, Test programs, licenced under GPL2 terms.

### Concepts ###

> Naca is a full set of tools / libraries that permits a complete migration for mainframe based central applications, to low costs server based infrastructure.

> These servers can use any operating system supporting Java JRE 1.5 or greater.

> Linux or Windows are fully supported, with 32 or 64 bits versions. 64 bits supports enables a much wider memory space than 32 bits.

> The challenges are important, as mainframe applications are critical for owner company daily production.

### Document coverage ###

> This document does not cover all aspects of the various steps required for a complete migration from a host/MVS world to a Java/Server based environment.

> However, the following points are detailed here:

  * Legacy Cobol application automatic conversion to Java
  * Utilities and tools used during migration preparation
  * Some utilities and tools used in the new environment, to ensure daily production

> Thus, this document is mainly targeted to issues involved by the automatic transcoding, and their solutions, as provided by the Naca software stack.

### Naca software stack ###

> Naca provides various tools, libraries and executable. They are usable in all or some steps of the conversion process.

> The list of these software resources includes:

  * Automatic CICS Cobol to Java transcoder.
  * Automatic Batch Cobol to Java transcoder.
  * Automatic DB2 stored procedure Cobol to UDB Java stored procedure transcoder.
  * Filepac scripts transcoder.
  * Runtime Java library used by all transcoded programs, in supported category.
  * External Sort utility.
  * Database utilities.
  * File transfer from host to server utility.
  * File encoding/decoding utilities, including complete support for EBCDIC / ASCII conversions.
  * Modified 3270 terminals emulation tools.

> The list of required servers includes:

  * Standard source code repository ("CVS" for exemple).
  * Standard build server ("AntHill Pro" for example).
  * Custom integration server for daily and on-demand transcoding and build.
  * NacaTools server, helping to centrally manage inventories, tests, operations, monitoring, statistics, ?
  * Database instances in DB2 and UDB forms...
  * Test servers for batch operations...
  * Test servers for online operations.
