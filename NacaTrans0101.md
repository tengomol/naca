# NacaTrans - Introduction #

## Introduction ##

> The NacaTrans implements a Cobol to Java transcoder engine.
> It's designed as a compiler, that takes Cobol BMS source files and output is java or XML files.
> As a compiler, it uses a traditional compiler architecture: lexer, syntax analyser, semantic analyser, generator.
> All these compilations steps are implemented in the single Naca's Nacatrans module.

### Document purpose ###

> This document won't explain internal architecture of NacaTrans, but only explains the configuration possibilities.
